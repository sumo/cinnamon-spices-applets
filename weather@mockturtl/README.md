## Setup



### OpenWeatherMap API Key

**OpenWeatherMap does not require API key anymore! Big Thanks to them for supporting this applet!**

### OpenWeatherMap Location
The following formats are supported:

- Zipcode, Country Code (e.g. 94111,US)
- Latitude, Longitude (e.g. 37.77,122.41)

* City, Country Code (e.g. London,UK), or ZIP, Country Code

If the location you try does not work, try using [OpenWeatherMap's finder](https://openweathermap.org/find) and paste the coordinates.
