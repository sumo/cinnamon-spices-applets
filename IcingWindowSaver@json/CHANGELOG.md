### 2.0.0

  * Added a version for Cinnamon 4.0 containing new features.
  * 4.0: Uses Muffin internally to track and manipulate windows. This allows the minimized and maximized states on windows to be saved. This version of the applet is now dependency-free.
  * 4.0: Added settings, including an option to restore windows on monitor change. This is useful for some display port monitors that cause hot plug events to occur on power off.

### 1.0.1

  * Added detection for missing dependencies.
  * Removed Babel.
