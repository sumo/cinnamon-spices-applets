# Radio++
This simple radio for Cinnamon with editable list of stations. Require moc player.
Special thanks for the improvements and translation NikoKrause (https://github.com/NikoKrause).
Now you can control the volume with the mouse wheel, and also mark the stations that are to be shown in the list.
